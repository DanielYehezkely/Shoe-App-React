## Overview

The Shoe Store project aims to simulate an online store experience. Users can browse different shoe products and see detailed information about each item. Although this project is still in progress, it showcases the basic functionalities of an e-commerce app, such as adding products to a cart.

This project helped me improve my skills in managing state, working with components, and creating a dynamic user interface.

## Features

- **Product Listings**: Display a list of available shoes with information like name, price, and description.
- **Product Details**: Users can click on a shoe to view more details about the product.
- **Add to Cart**: The basic functionality to add products to a shopping cart (in progress).
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to various screen sizes, providing a user-friendly shopping experience.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the UI and managing application state.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core language for the application logic.
- **CSS3**: Used for styling and ensuring the application is responsive.
- **HTML5**: Provides the structure for the app within the JSX format.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using npm or yarn.
3. Start the development server to browse the shoe store locally.
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to explore the store.
